## Notes

API Integration: Fetching trivia questions from an external API and handling network requests was challenging, especially when dealing with asynchronous code and ensuring a smooth user experience.

Data Parsing: Parsing the JSON response from the API and decoding it into Swift objects required careful handling of data types and structures. Dealing with HTML entities in the question text added an extra layer of complexity.
